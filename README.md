=====

This library provides a solution for creating DOT files for directed and undirected graphs simply by implementing a set of interfaces. The output will generate DOT files (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language), which can be viewed with programs such as GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org/).

Sample output can be found under the *Sample Output* folder. The .gv files are generating by **gvnet** and the .jpg files are sample output that has been generated from GraphViz. The TestProject included allows you to easily create a graph of your choosing and view the output that gets generated.
